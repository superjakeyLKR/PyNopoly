# PyNopoly
A version of Monopoly I made in Python
## Note:
If the file "settings.json" doesn't exist, it will be automatically made with the default values.
### TODO:
#### Make houses work
#### Fix bugs (probably)
#### Loading games. (Difficult because I don't know to deserialise the classes once you save them.)
